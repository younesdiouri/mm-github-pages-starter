### Who are you?

I've been into coding since my younger age. I thrive for fashionable frameworks, clean documentations (Yes I do!),  and partake in OS projects (Angular Firebase, Api Platform), Hackatons, coding challenges like codewars. I look forward to be part of a project where I can learn and where developers can express themselves at their best!
